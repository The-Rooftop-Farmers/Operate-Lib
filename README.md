# Operate

Easy stepper motor control class for Arduino with homing and position limits.

## Overview

Operate is a lightweight Arduino library designed for easy and flexible control of stepper motors. It provides a simple class interface for basic stepper operations, including:

- Setting step and direction pins
- Setting motor speed (via microsecond delay)
- Moving the motor a specific number of steps in either direction
- Homing with a limit switch
- Enforcing position limits

This library is ideal for DIY CNC, pick-and-place, robotics, or any project that needs robust, basic stepper motor movement control.

## Features

- Simple API for stepper motor movement
- Homing function using a limit switch
- Position limiting to prevent out-of-range movement
- Speed adjustment using microsecond delay
- No hardware timer usage â€“ works on any Arduino digital pins
